# Let Nothing Go to Waste Bone Broth

_By Steven Syrek_

It was only a matter of time before broth, the most boring of all possible soups, became a foodie trend. In New York City, you can line up for the privilege of buying this clear, almost tasteless liquid and persuade yourself that its alleged health benefits are, in fact, worth [over $100/gallon](https://brodo.com). But you needn't be on the [cutting edge of wellness](https://goop.com) or even a Native American wannabe who believes that [you should eat the whole animal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j48GDZKZTUo) to appreciate the ease and practicality of making your own broth at home. Use it as stock, drink it when you're sick, or liven up any recipe that ordinarily calls for plain, boring water. Make a huge amount at once, and freeze it for later use.

## Ingredients

- Bones from any one type of animal
- Water
- Salt
- Time

## Preparation

1. Place all the bones in your largest saucepan, fill it with water, and bring to a boil. Add a dash of salt. Add a [bay leaf](http://www.seriouseats.com/2014/03/ask-the-food-lab-whats-the-point-of-bay-leaves.html), if you want.
2. Turn the heat down as low as it can go, and partially cover the pan (leave a small opening). Simmer for as long as you can, the longer the better. Eight hours is probably the minimum worth doing, because you want the bones to release their mineral content and also because marrow. If you have a slow cooker, you can just leave it going for a day or more.
3. Let the broth cool and then strain it out into containers for storage. Discard the bones and all the gross bits.
