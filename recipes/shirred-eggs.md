# Shirred Eggs for Lovers

_By Steven Syrek_

Let's be honest. Eggs are the hardest thing to cook. If you can reliably cook eggs well, then you can cook anything. [Seriously](https://youtu.be/_Ft0cwxjBKE?t=51m). Baked eggs, as presented here, are a nice alternative to the usual pan-fried specimens. Best of all, they're dead simple. This particular recipe I will admit to having stolen from [Mark Bittman](http://markbittman.com). But Mark wants you to eat better, so he won't mind. Make these for your romantic partner for breakfast, and you won't have to worry about dessert. I _a-shirr_ you! LOL!

## Ingredients

- Cooking oil or butter
- Eggs
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper
- Freshly ground nutmug
- Various bottomings and toppings (optional)
- Toast (optional, but not really) with ground cardamom

## Preparation

1. Heat your oven (preheat?) to 375 degrees Fahrenheit (190 degrees Celsius).
2. For each egg you plan to cook, put a little bit of butter or oil in a ramekin. Please don't tell me you don't own any ramekins.
3. If you want, you can add cream to the ramekin at this stage, harissa, diced tomatoes, tomato sauce, cilantro, feta cheese, or anything else you think might go well with eggs. I have tried all of those.
4. Break 1 egg into each cup.
5. Sprinkle the tiniest amount of freshly ground nutmeg on top. This is my idea, and not Mark's, and I want you to know that. OK, I kind of also stole it from [The Flavor Bible](http://a.co/2vaHeP0), but I'm an [artist](https://quoteinvestigator.com/2013/03/06/artists-steal/)!
6. Put the ramekins on a baking sheet or just directly in the oven. If you're cooking more than 1 or 2, use a baking sheet to ensure consistency.
7. Bake for exactly 12 minutes.
8. Remove and let cool. Eggs will continue cooking after you remove them from heat, so don't be a perfectionist. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Serve with buttered toast. Eat messily. If you're a [baller](https://www.wikihow.com/Be-a-Baller), you'll also sprinkle your buttered toast with the tiniest amount of ground cardamom. This is also my idea, and it's a damn good one!
