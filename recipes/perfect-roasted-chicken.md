# Perfect Roasted Chicken

_By Steven Syrek_

Roast chicken is delightful and makes life better. This recipe is dead simple to prepare once you know it by heart, which you will after doing it once. You will also please everyone you serve it to, in addition to yourself. It requires only basic ingredients—hence the lack of an ingredients section—and it's hard to get it wrong; chicken is rather forgiving even if you do. The trick is not to overcook it. I like the meat to touch 145 degrees Fahrenheit at the center, i.e. less than the [USDA recommendation](https://www.foodsafety.gov/keep/charts/meatchart.html) of 165 degrees. This recipe will, depending on your oven, probably get you somewhere in between. Keep your prep area clean, treat raw chicken like toxic waste, and use a meat thermometer. But food safety involves a [number of factors](http://blog2.thermoworks.com/2016/04/thermal-tips-simple-roasted-chicken/), so don't trust me or [anyone else](http://www.barfblog.com/2017/03/cookbooks-give-readers-mostly-bad-advice-on-food-safety/). Do your own research, draw your own conclusions, and don't come to me with your salmonella concerns. Also, if you do it right, the skin comes out awesome.

1. Procure any number of chicken parts. You can try larger or smaller pieces, or even a whole bird if you want (definitely use a thermometer in this case). I prefer thighs, myself, and tend to cook 6-8 at a time. Breasts also work beautifully, but expect them to be a little bit drier. Do not use boneless cuts.
2. Preheat your oven to 450 degrees Fahrenheit (or approximately 230 degrees Celsius). Check the temperature using a standalone oven thermometer. I make no guarantees about the results of your cooking endeavors if you deign to trust your oven's built-in thermometer.
3. Place the chicken parts _skin side up_ in a large, rectangular baking pan (with steep sides). There should be some space between them. Note: you can get better results if you preheat the pan a bit, too, along with the olive oil. In that case, you'll need to turn the chicken parts over a few times in the oil to cover them, then season.
4. Drizzle the chicken parts generously with extra virgin olive oil, and then sprinkle them judiciously with salt (preferably big, flaky kosher salt) and freshly ground black pepper (do not cheap out on your pepper or just stop reading now and go do something else).
5. Sprinkle the pan with any other seasoning of your choosing (optional). Many markets sell seasoning blends for poultry, so you could experiment with those. I've used cumin, sumac, thyme, paprika, and Japanese shiso pepper (these either alone or in combination) to good effect. You can swish things around a bit at this point, so at least the underside of the chicken parts are coated with oil (to prevent them from sticking to the pan), but making sure to maintain the space between them.
6. Put the pan in the oven, and bake for 15 minutes.
7. Use metal tongs to flip the chicken parts over, taking care not to rend the skin.
8. Bake for another 15 minutes.
9. Flip the parts carefully again so they are once more skin side up—this part is critical.
10. Bake for another 15 minutes.
11. Remove the pan from the oven, and let the chicken rest a few minutes, or until the pan juices calm down and stop burning you.
12. Serve with rice and/or your favorite sides, reserving the pan juices for gravy.
