# Correct Pasta

_By Steven Syrek_

This is the correct way to make pasta. It's slightly more complicated than just boiling water, but not much. In fact, it's still easy enough that you might as well do it the right way.

## Ingredients

- Dried or fresh pasta (do not discard the packaging without noting the recommended cooking time)
- Salt
- Extra virgin olive oil (optional)
- Freshly ground black pepper
- Parmesan cheese

## Preparation

1. Fill your largest saucepan (five quarts is typical) with cold water. [Do not ever](https://nyti.ms/2kgWiQY) cook with warm or hot water directly from the tap, thinking it's a shortcut. Do not use a smaller saucepan, thinking that you're saving either time or the environment. Go eat [salad](greek-salad-for-winners.md) instead.
2. Place it on your largest burner, and set the heat to the highest setting. I wouldn't do this five minutes before you plan to eat.
3. Go read an article in the [London Review of Books](https://www.lrb.co.uk/).
4. When the water comes to a rolling boil, sprinkle in some salt. Don't overdo it, or your pasta will taste salty, not seasoned. And don't add salt to the cold water first, as you may discolor your nice cooking equipment. You can add a tiny bit of olive oil to keep the pasta from sticking together, but it's not strictly necessary.
5. While the water is still boiling vigorously, dump in all the pasta at once. If you're using spaghetti, you'll probably [want to have broken](http://www.ef.com/english-resources/english-grammar/future-perfect/) it up in advance. If you used a large enough saucepan, as specified in step one, the water should keep boiling even after you've added the pasta. If you didn't, the water may stop boiling when you add the cold pasta, and you'll end up standing there looking sad, wishing you'd heeded my advice. Too bad.
6. Stir the pasta with a wooden spoon, so it doesn't just settle and stick together. Leave the heat on high, and resist the temptation to cover the pot. Or cover the pot, and learn the hard way why you shouldn't.
7. While the pasta is cooking, empty out your sink and place a large colander into it. If you do not own a colander, turn off the stove, go buy one, and start over again with step 1. Don't worry, pasta is cheap. Unless you used fancy fresh pasta or actually went to the trouble to make your own (costly in time, at least). In either of those cases, you really should have known what you were up against.
8. When the pasta has cooked for exactly as long as its packaging specifies, empty the saucepan into the colander. You should probably wear oven mitts to do this. If the handles of the saucepan don't burn you, the water vapor from the boiling water you dump into your sink will. If you prefer your pasta more [al dente](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_dente), you can take it off the heat a bit early. You may have to experiment, though, to find what you like best. Overcooked pasta can become rubbery and gelatinous. Undercooked pasta will cause gustatory stress-rejection. Old pasta may take longer to cook. This whole operation could be affected by your [altitude](http://www.denverpost.com/2008/05/05/cooking-pasta-at-altitude/).
9. At this point, your pasta is ready for consumption. If you're making pasta salad, let it cool completely before refrigerating it or adding anything else (like veggies or mayonnaise, which you don't want to cook). If you plan to serve it with a sauce, for example the [World's Greatest Tomato Sauce](worlds-greatest-tomato-sauce.md), your best bet is to return the pasta to the saucepan immediately and just as immediately combine it with the **hot** tomato sauce, which you surely had simmering happily in its own little saucepan nearby. If you take a cold jar of store-bought tomato sauce out of your refrigerator and dump it on top of your pasta before serving it, the malevolent forces of the universe will take notice and align against you. If you do it right, the pasta will absorb the tomato sauce (or pesto or whatever sauce you use) and cook a little bit more. This is A Good Thing.
10. Portion out the pasta onto plates to serve. Or _a plate_ if you're dining alone. Sorry. If there's any sauce left, you can pour more on top. Grind out some pepper over your nice dinner, and then add the coup de gr√¢ce: Parmesan cheese. If you followed my advice from the [front page](../README.md) of this repo, you bought a chunk of real, Italian Parmesan cheese and not that pre-grated [wood pulp](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-02-16/the-parmesan-cheese-you-sprinkle-on-your-penne-could-be-wood) garbage. If you even think about letting that inferior, non-food product touch my tomato sauce (remember: even if _you_ made it, it's still _mine_), I will be furious. Instead, buy the real thing and grate it with a [microplane](https://us.microplane.com/kitchen_en_us/). The Parmesan will fall upon your pasta like a soft morning snow. You can't add too much. If you must, you can use a "cheese grater." If you must, I suppose, you can also pee into your sink.
