# Fry Rice
*By Weathon*

This is really to make and realy teaty, good for developers to cook when they are busy and do not want to order food. It might not be really healthy though, so do not eat that too much.

English is not my first language. So if there is anything confusing in the document, please help me fix it. 
And I am only a high school programmer (only cook for sometimes my parents are busy), 
so this recipt is just based on my not-much experience. So if you have any way to improve the recipet, please edit it!

## Ingredients
- Egg
- Rice (Me and most Chinese like to use cold rice, because they are dried, so it is easy to fry)
- Chopped Green Onion
- Luncheon meat (oppotional)
- Salt
- Any other things you want to add
    - For example, corn (personal don't like), shrimp, chicken (cooked) , <del> and if you like you can add some hard drive or intel chips fragments. I myslef like to add some python code segment, too. </del>
## Preparation
There are two ways to make fried rice, one is cook the egg first then add rice to fry it. Another way is "wrap" the egg liquid to the rice then fry them together. I personally like both. So I will show them all.

### The first way

1. Put oil in to pan

``` IF YOU.LIKE_RAW_GREEN_ONION == FALSE```


some people like more soy sause while others like more salt-and-onion flavour. Depend on you, you can choice which way to cook.
