# Fry Rice
*By Wayne Guo (GitHub: Weathon)*

This is really easy to make and really tasty, good for developers to cook when they are busy and do not want to order food. It might not be really healthy though, so do not eat that too much.

English is not my first language. So if there is anything confusing in the document, please help me fix it. 
And I am only a high school programmer (only cook for sometimes my parents are busy), 
so this recipe is just based on my not-much experience. So if you have any way to improve the recipe, please edit it!

## Ingredients
- Egg
- Rice (I and most Chinese like to use cold rice because they are dried, so it is easy to fry)
- Chopped Green Onion (If you like it)
- Luncheon meat (optional)
- Salt
- Any other things you want to add
    - For example, corn (personally don't like), shrimp, chicken (cooked) , <del>, and if you like you can add some hard drive or intel chips fragments. I myself like to add some python code segment, too. </del>
## Preparation
There are two ways to make fried rice, one is to cook the egg first then add rice to fry it. Another way is to "wrap" the egg liquid to the rice then fry them together. I personally like both. So I will show them all.

### The first way

0. Beat (I mean to mix the egg, I don't know if this is the right term) eggs
1. Put oil into the pan, do not put too much
2. Heat it a little bit, pour the egg in and fry it 
 
3. <del> When it is 80% cooked, take it out. then put oil in the pan again, put all you sides in (Your chicken, shrimp, etc)</del>  

3. Find a new way: 
When it is 80% cooked, break them in pieces, then put sides in  


```
IF YOU.LIKE_RAW_GREEN_ONION == FALSE
put the onion in as well 
End IF 
``` 

4. Stir fry them a little bit them put the egg back in with rice
<del> 6. Break the egg into pieces </del>
5. Continue stir fry them for a while
6. Put soil sauce, salt, and maybe also pepper and paprika if you like.  

``` 
IF YOU.LIKE_RAW_GREEN_ONION == TRUE
put the onion in at this time  
End IF 
```  

9. Stir them and ready to serve

some people like more soy sauce while others like more salt-and-onion flavor. Depend on you, you can choose which way to cook.



### The second way

1. Break an egg into a big bowl with rice
2. Stir them together, let most of the rice covered by the egg liquid
3. Put oil into the pan, heat it a little bit
4. Put your sides in, stir fry them for a while. (Same as the first way, put the onion in now if you do not like raw onion.)
5. Put the Rice in, make it "paved" the pan, maybe you want to depress them for a little bit
6. Let it sit there and fry it for a while 
7. Stir the rice, add repeat step 5 for a couple of times until the egg is cooked through and become a nicely golden color. Do not burn it.
8. Put soil sauce, salt, and maybe also pepper and paprika if you like. 
9. Stir them well and ready to serve.
