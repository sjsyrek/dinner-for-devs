# Fry Rice
*By Wayne Guo (GitHUb: Weathon)*

This is really easy to make and really tasty, good for developers to cook when they are busy and do not want to order food. It might not be really healthy though, so do not eat that too much.

English is not my first language. So if there is anything confusing in the document, please help me fix it. 
And I am only a high school programmer (only cook for sometimes my parents are busy), 
so this recipt is just based on my not-much experience. So if you have any way to improve the recipet, please edit it!

## Ingredients
- Egg
- Rice (Me and most Chinese like to use cold rice, because they are dried, so it is easy to fry)
- Chopped Green Onion
- Luncheon meat (oppotional)
- Salt
- Any other things you want to add
    - For example, corn (personal don't like), shrimp, chicken (cooked) , <del> and if you like you can add some hard drive or intel chips fragments. I myslef like to add some python code segment, too. </del>
## Preparation
There are two ways to make fried rice, one is cook the egg first then add rice to fry it. Another way is "wrap" the egg liquid to the rice then fry them together. I personally like both. So I will show them all.

### The first way

0. Beat (I mean mix the egg, I don't know if this is the right term) eggs
1. Put oil in to pan, do not put too much
2. Heat it a little bit, pour the egg in and fry it 
 
3. <del> When it is 80% cooked, take it out. then put oil in the pan agian, put all you sides in (Your chicken, shrimp, etc)</del>  

3. Find a new way: 
When it is 80% cooked, breaked them in pieces, then put sides in  


```
IF YOU.LIKE_RAW_GREEN_ONION == FALSE
put the onion in as well 
End IF 
``` 

4. Stir fry them a little bit them put the egg back in with rice
<del> 6. Break the egg in to pieces </del>
5. Continue stir fry them for a while
6. Put soil sauce, salt, and maybe also pepper and paprika if you like.  

``` 
IF YOU.LIKE_RAW_GREEN_ONION == TRUE
put the onion in at tis time  
End IF 
```  

9. Stir them and ready to serve

some people like more soy sause while others like more salt-and-onion flavour. Depend on you, you can choice which way to cook.
