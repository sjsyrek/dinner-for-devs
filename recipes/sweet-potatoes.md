# Cook One of Those Huge Japanese Sweet Potatoes

_By Steven Syrek_

This recipe will actually work for any large potato, but why make a plain white potato when you can have the king of all tubers: the big, purple [Satsumaimo](http://www.japanesefood101.com/index.php/more-information-on/satsumaimo/). So easy to cook this basically isn't even a recipe, one of these creamy, chestnut-y spuds is the perfect meal for the laziest of all developers. Stick it in the oven, come back later, and enjoy. Make sure you put something on top, though, or it can be a little cloying even when it's moist, just because there's so much of it. I cycle between butter, ghee, miso, and [kasu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sake_kasu). Miso you can find anywhere, but if you want to experiment with more varieties of it, you need to go to a Japanese supermarket. Kasu is sake lees, the sediment left over from the making of "rice wine." You may have to order it online, but it's totally, completely worth it. Since the potato will come out of the oven piping hot, you can also use it to insta-cook whatever fillings strike your fancy, sort of like a Turkish [kumpir](http://www.enjoy-istanbul.com/street-food/kumpir-turkish-baked-potato/). Search the Internet for ideas.

## Ingredients

- Sweet potato(es)
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper
- Butter, miso, or kasu (optional)

## Preparation

1. (Pre)heat the oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit (220 degrees Celsius).
2. Wash the potatoes thoroughly, and poke each one with a knife in a few places.
3. Did you remember to poke your potatoes with a knife? You really don't want to forget that step!
4. Put them in the oven on foil (but not wrapped in it). Bake for at least an hour, turning once. Larger potatoes may require slightly more time, but this is OK, because slightly too much time is better than not quite enough.
5. Remove from the oven, cut in half lengthwise, sprinkle with the salt and pepper, and add any other toppings. When adding butter/miso/kasu (or some combination thereof), I like to make further slits into each half of the potato so the topping seeps in. Yum.
