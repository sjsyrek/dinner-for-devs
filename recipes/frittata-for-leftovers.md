# A Frittata for Leftovers, Especially Pasta

_By Steven Syrek_

"Frittata" is literally the most delicious word to pronounce. It sparkles on the tongue, and everyone smiles when they hear it. Show up to a party with a frittata in hand, and you will be a hero as your humdrum get-together is transformed into a sophisticated midday meal at an Italian villa. This is a versatile dish, and even though it contains eggs, you should feel free to consume it for breakfast, lunch, dinner, or whatever you call that meal when you finally stumble into your home at 3 am after a night of drinking too much. In the latter case, you should probably make it ahead of time. Although it's not mandatory, you would be a fool not to try out the full blown version of this recipe, which requires you to first master my [World's Greatest Tomato Sauce](recipes/worlds-greatest-tomato-sauce.md) and [Correct Pasta](recipes/correct-pasta.md) recipes. One problem with both of those recipes is the amount of extra food you can end up with. While you should be using your extra sauce to make [shakshuka](recipes/shakshuka.md), what about all that pasta you thought you wanted to eat? Wonder no more.

## Ingredients

- Cooking oil
- 1 medium onion, sliced and diced
- 1..n cloves of garlic, where n is the amount of garlic you want in your frittata
- Leftover pasta (technically optionally, but highly desirable)
- Herbs and spices—whatever you have, whatever you like
- 1 or 2 sausages cooked in [World's Greatest Tomato Sauce](recipes/worlds-greatest-tomato-sauce.md), cut into small pieces
- Cheese(s), following the simple rule that more cheeses are better than fewer cheeses, grated
- 8 eggs, whisked (but not _really, really_ whisked)
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper
- Any leftover vegetables, cooked or uncooked, that you feel guilty about not eating (I'm looking at you, single unused bell pepper), cut into small pieces (optional)
- Any leftover meats, shredded or cut into small pieces (optional)

## Preparation

1. Preheat, which is to say heat, your oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit (or 200 degrees Celsius)
2. Set your cast iron skillet over medium-high heat until warm. Flick a water droplet into it—if it sizzles, then it's ready. If you do not own a cast iron skillet, you should turn off both your stove and oven, go out and buy one, season it, and then resume this recipe.
3. Add your cooking oil to the skillet. Allow it to heat up before adding any other ingredients.
3. If you're cooking with raw meat, brown it in the oil and then remove.
4. Sauté the onions until translucent. Add the garlic, if you're using it.
5. Add in the veggies one type at a time, depending on how long they normally take to cook. Potatoes take longer than mushrooms take longer than peppers. If you're bold, you can even try cashews, pistachios, or hazelnuts.
6. Add the meat, and mix it around. If you want to use tofu, add that now, too.
7. Add the herbs and spices. You can't go wrong with a stalk or two of coriander and parsley (chopped), a few basil leaves, a handful of oregano, thyme, or majoram, or a sprinkling of cumin seeds. Feel free to experiment. Add a teaspoon or so of salt. Add the pepper. Don't worry about overdoing it, because you're going to be adding eggs soon, and they need to be bullied around so they don't dominate the dish too much. Secret ingredient: a little bit of freshly ground nutmeg. _For the win_.
8. Stir everything around and cook for another minute or two.
9. Make sure the mixture is spread out evenly, and sprinkle the grated cheese on top. You can use whatever cheese you have. Fontina, cheddar, Gruyère, Parmesan, and feta are all fine choices, though some go better with others. I suppose you could use mozzarella and Gorgonzola together with the Gruyère and Parmesan and call the dish a Frittata Quattro Formaggi—this is a decent method of making friends for life.
10. Let the cheese melt a little, then pour the whisked eggs on top of the whole mixture. Tilt the skillet to make sure the eggs evenly cover everything. Cook for another minute or two. You should see the eggs just start to set around the edge of the skillet.
11. Put the whole pan into the oven, and bake for 8-10 minutes.
12. Remove the skillet from the oven, and cut a slit into the center of the frittata. If the eggs are still runny, bake for another few minutes.
13. Once the frittata is fully cooked, let it rest for around 5 minutes.
14. Cut into wedges, and serve. You would not be wrong to eat it with hot sauce.

Leftover frittata will keep for several days, so don't worry about making too much.
