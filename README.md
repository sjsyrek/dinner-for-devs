# Dinner for Devs
## Simple recipes for lazy programmers

I love cooking and learning about food. I have met quite a few developers who feel the same way. Recipes are just like code, right? I have also met quite a few developers who do not feel this way, and who use ignorance as an excuse for a poor or uninteresting diet. Your meal choices are your own, but if you'd like to have a few easy-to-memorize, go-to dinner options, here are some possibilities for your next meal. Bon appétit!

### Basic assumptions

- Only use freshly ground black pepper (i.e. buy black peppercorns in a grinder). If you use pre-ground pepper from a shaker, please move on to a different website.
- [Kosher salt](http://www.bonappetit.com/story/what-is-kosher-salt) is preferred to other varieties, but you can use fancy sea salt or whatever if you must. Don't use the cheap stuff.
- Do not purchase Parmesan cheese that looks like sawdust—[it probably is](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-02-16/the-parmesan-cheese-you-sprinkle-on-your-penne-could-be-wood).
- [Plugrá butter](http://plugra.com/product-information/) or any butter with a slightly higher fat content ("European butter") is preferred, especially for baking. Do not buy salted butter. Certainly do not buy margarine, or I will find you.
- Let butter warm to room temperature before you use it. Or just [don't refrigerate it at all](http://www.thekitchn.com/does-butter-really-need-to-be-refrigerated-224036). Likewise for [eggs](http://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2014/09/11/336330502/why-the-u-s-chills-its-eggs-and-most-of-the-world-doesnt).
- Get the best extra virgin olive oil you can find, preferably Greek.
- Safflower oil is a good, healthy choice for high temperature cooking, including frying, but only when you specifically don't want the oil to have any flavor.
- If you burn your cooking oil, dump it out and try again. It's ruined.
- In general, "burnt" is not a flavor, and may be [carcinogenic](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/diet/cooked-meats-fact-sheet).
- If you need to dump out copious amounts of oil or fat, let it cool and pour it into the garbage. If you pour it down the sink, [you will regret it](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/apr/21/huge-10-ton-fatberg-removed-chelsea-sewer-london).
- Never put food into a cold cooking vessel. Heat it up first, along with any cooking fat you may be using.
- [Blanch and shock veggies](http://dish.allrecipes.com/blanching-and-shocking-vegetables/) when appropriate before cooking them, if you can spare the time. That means having ice available. It's worth it.
- Learn [how to cut onions](http://www.seriouseats.com/2016/11/knife-skills-how-to-slice-and-dice-an-onion.html) correctly. Do not just dice them for everything. Do not cut off the tip of your thumb.
- If you invest in no other serious tool for cooking, at least get yourself a decent [chef's knife](http://www.wusthof.com/products/classic-ikon#/1).
- Use a serrated blade when slicing tomatoes and other thin-skinned foods. Learn to use a paring knife. Use kitchen shears (the big scissors in the wooden knife block you bought at Target) to cut anything weird or stubborn. I use them to cut basil, because slicing it seems stupid.
- Deposit your "cheese grater" in the nearest trash receptacle and purchase a [microplane](https://us.microplane.com/kitchen_en_us/).
- A [mandoline slicer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=At02GJDnVUs) can be handy, if you actually remember to use it. Try not to hurt yourself.
- Get an oven thermometer and use it. Get a meat thermometer and use it.
